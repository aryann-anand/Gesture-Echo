# GestureEcho

GestureEcho is a real-time advanced solution designed to bridge communication gaps between the Deaf and the hearing world by translating American Sign Language (ASL) into spoken words. This innovative system utilizes a compact Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to recognize and predict ASL gestures with high accuracy.

## Features

- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Translates ASL gestures into spoken words with minimal latency.
- **High Accuracy**: Powered by a custom-built CNN model to ensure precise gesture recognition.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive UI that supports seamless communication.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Available on both desktop and mobile platforms.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easily expandable to include additional sign languages in the future.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML5, CSS3
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Machine Learning**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Deployment**: Docker, Heroku/Netlify
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GestureEcho.git
   cd GestureEcho

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

3. Set up the Python environment and install ML dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the application:
  ```bash
  npm start

5. Access the app at http://localhost:3000.

How It Works
Data Collection & Preprocessing: The model is trained using a dataset of ASL gestures. Each gesture is labeled and converted into a format that can be processed by the CNN.

Model Training: A CNN is employed to learn gesture patterns and improve recognition accuracy through continuous training and testing.

Real-Time Prediction: The trained model is integrated into the application to recognize and translate gestures in real time.

Speech Output: Once a gesture is recognized, the system converts the text output into spoken words using text-to-speech (TTS) technology.

Usage
Launch the application.
Position your hand in view of the camera.
Perform the ASL gesture.
GestureEcho will display and speak the corresponding translation.
Future Enhancements
Expand gesture support for more sign languages.
Improve model accuracy with larger datasets.
Add offline support for use in low-internet environments.
Incorporate gesture-to-text for multi-language support.
